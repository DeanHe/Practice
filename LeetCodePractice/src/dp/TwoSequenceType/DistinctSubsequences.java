/*
Given two strings s and t, return the number of distinct subsequences of s which equals t.

A string's subsequence is a new string formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the remaining characters' relative positions. (i.e., "ACE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).

It is guaranteed the answer fits on a 32-bit signed integer.



Example 1:

Input: s = "rabbbit", t = "rabbit"
Output: 3
Explanation:
As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from S.
rabbbit
rabbbit
rabbbit
Example 2:

Input: s = "babgbag", t = "bag"
Output: 5
Explanation:
As shown below, there are 5 ways you can generate "bag" from S.
babgbag
babgbag
babgbag
babgbag
babgbag


Constraints:

1 <= s.length, t.length <= 1000
s and t consist of English letters.

analysis:
How do you define "distinct" subsequence? Clearly, the 'distinct' here mean different operation combination, not the final string of subsequence. Otherwise, the result is always 0 or 1.
When you see string problem that is about subsequence or matching, dynamic programming method should come to mind naturally. The key is to find the initial and changing condition.
mem[i][j]ï¼Œrepresent S[:i] matches T[:j] count
Let W(i, j) stand for the number of subsequences of S(0, i) equals to T(0, j).
If S.charAt(i) == T.charAt), W(i, j) = W(i-1, j-1) + W(i-1,j); Otherwise, W(i, j) = W(i-1,j).
