/*Given a set of words without duplicates, find all word squares you can build from them.

A sequence of words forms a valid word square if the kth row and column read the exact same string, where 0 â‰¤ k < max(numRows, numColumns).

For example, the word sequence ["ball","area","lead","lady"] forms a word square because each word reads the same both horizontally and vertically.

a r e a
l e a d
l a d y
Example
Given a set ["area","lead","wall","lady","ball"]
return [["wall","area","lead","lady"],["ball","area","lead","lady"]]
Explanation:
The output consists of two word squares. The order of output does not matter (just the order of words in each word square matters).

Given a set ["abat","baba","atan","atal"]
return [["baba","abat","baba","atan"],["baba","abat","baba","atal"]]
Explanation:
The output consists of two word squares. The order of output does not matter (just the order of words in each word square matters).
Notice
There are at least 1 and at most 1000 words.
All words will have the exact same length.
Word length is at least 1 and at most 5.
Each word contains only lowercase English alphabet a-z.*/
