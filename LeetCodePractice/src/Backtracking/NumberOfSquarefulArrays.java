/*Given an array A of non-negative integers, the array is squareful if for every pair of adjacent elements, their sum is a perfect square.
Return the number of permutations of A that are squareful.  Two permutations A1 and A2 differ if and only if there is some index i such that A1[i] != A2[i].
 
Example 1:

Input: [1,17,8]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
[1,8,17] and [17,8,1] are the valid permutations.
Example 2:

Input: [2,2,2]
Output: 1
 
Note:

1 <= A.length <= 12
0 <= A[i] <= 1e9*/
