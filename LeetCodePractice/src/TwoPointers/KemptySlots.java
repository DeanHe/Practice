/*Given an array flowers consists of number from 1 to N. Each number in the array represents the place where the flower will open in that day.
For example, flowers[i] = x means that the unique flower that blooms at day i will be at position x, where i and x will be in the range from 1 to N.
Also given an integer k, you need to output in which day there exists two flowers in the status of blooming, and also the number of flowers between them is k and these flowers are not blooming.
If there isnâ€™t such day, output -1.

Example 1:
Input: 
flowers: [1,3,2]
k: 1
Output: 2
Explanation: In the second day, the first and the third flower have become blooming.
Example 2:
Input: 
flowers: [1,2,3]
k: 1
Output: -1
