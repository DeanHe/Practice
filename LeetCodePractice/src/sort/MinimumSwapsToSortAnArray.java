package sort;
/*
Given an array of n distinct elements, find the minimum number of swaps required to sort the array.

Examples:

Input: {4, 3, 2, 1}
Output: 2
Explanation: Swap index 0 with 3 and 1 with 2 to
              form the sorted array {1, 2, 3, 4}.

Input: {1, 5, 4, 3, 2}
Output: 2

This can be easily done by visualizing the problem as a graph.
We will have n nodes and an edge directed from node i to node j if the element at i’th index must be present at j’th index in the sorted array.

TC: O(n Log n)
Auxiliary Space: O(n)
