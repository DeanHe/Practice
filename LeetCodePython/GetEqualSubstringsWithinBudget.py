"""
You are given two strings s and t of the same length and an integer maxCost.

You want to change s to t. Changing the ith character of s to ith character of t costs |s[i] - t[i]| (i.e., the absolute difference between the ASCII values of the characters).

Return the maximum length of a substring of s that can be changed to be the same as the corresponding substring of t with a cost less than or equal to maxCost. If there is no substring from s that can be changed to its corresponding substring from t, return 0.

Example 1:
Input: s = "abcd", t = "bcdf", maxCost = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: "abc" of s can change to "bcd".
That costs 3, so the maximum length is 3.

Example 2:
Input: s = "abcd", t = "cdef", maxCost = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: Each character in s costs 2 to change to character in t,  so the maximum length is 1.

Example 3:
Input: s = "abcd", t = "acde", maxCost = 0
Output: 1
Explanation: You cannot make any change, so the maximum length is 1.

Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 10^5
t.length == s.length
0 <= maxCost <= 10^6
s and t consist of only lowercase English letters.

hints:
1 Calculate the differences between a[i] and b[i].
2 Use a sliding window to track the longest valid substring.
