"""
Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

Example 1:
Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.

Example 2:
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.

Example 3:
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.

Constraints:
1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000
text1 and text2 consist of only lowercase English characters.

hint:
1 Try dynamic programming. DP[i][j] represents the longest common subsequence of text1[0 ... i] & text2[0 ... j].
2 DP[i][j] = DP[i - 1][j - 1] + 1 , if text1[i] == text2[j] DP[i][j] = max(DP[i - 1][j], DP[i][j - 1]) , otherwise
