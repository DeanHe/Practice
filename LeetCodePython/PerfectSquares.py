"""
Given an integer n, return the least number of perfect square numbers that sum to n.
A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself. For example, 1, 4, 9, and 16 are perfect squares while 3 and 11 are not.


Example 1:
Input: n = 12
Output: 3
Explanation: 12 = 4 + 4 + 4.

Example 2:
Input: n = 13
Output: 2
Explanation: 13 = 4 + 9.

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 10^4
