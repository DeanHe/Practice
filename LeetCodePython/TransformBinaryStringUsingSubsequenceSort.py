"""
You are given a binary string s.

You are also given an array of strings strs, where each strs[i] has the same length as s and consists of characters '0', '1', and '?'. Each '?' can be replaced by either '0' or '1'.

You may perform the following operation any number of times (including zero):

Choose any subsequence sub of s.
Sort sub in non-decreasing order.
Replace the chosen subsequence in s with the sorted sub, keeping all other characters unchanged.
Return a boolean array ans, where ans[i] is true if it's possible to replace all '?' in strs[i] with '0' or '1' and transform s into the resulting string using the allowed operation above, otherwise return false.

Example 1:
Input: s = "101", strs = ["1?1","0?1","0?0"]
Output: [true,true,false]

Explanation:
i	strs[i]	Replacement	Result strs[i]	Operation(s)	Result
0	"1?1"	? → 0	"101"	Matches s.	true
1	"0?1"	? → 1	"011"	Select the subsequence at indices [0..2] of s → "101".
Sort "101" to get "011" = strs[i].	true
2	"0?0"	? → 0 or 1	"000" or "010"	Not feasible.	false
Thus, ans = [true, true, false].

Example 2:
Input: s = "1100", strs = ["0011","11?1","1?1?"]
Output: [true,false,true]

Explanation:
i	strs[i]	Replacement	Result strs[i]	Operation(s)	Result
0	"0011"	-	"0011"	Select the subsequence at indices [0..3] of s → "1100".
Sort "1100" to get "0011" = strs[i].	true
1	"11?1"	? → 0	"1101"	Not feasible.	false
2	"1?1?"	First ? → 0
Second ? → 0	"1010"	Select the subsequence at indices [1, 2] of s → "10".
Sort "10" to get "01", so s = "1010".	true
Thus, ans = [true, false, true].

Example 3:
Input: s = "1010", strs = ["0011"]
Output: [true]

Explanation:
i	strs[i]	Replacement	Result strs[i]	Operation(s)	Result
0	"0011"	-	"0011"	Select the subsequence at indices [0, 2, 3] of s → "110".
Sort "110" to get "011", so s = "0011" = strs[i].	true
Thus, ans = [true].

Constraints:
1 <= n == s.length <= 2000
s[i] is either '0' or '1'.
1 <= strs.length <= 2000
strs[i].length == n
strs[i] is either '0', '1', or '?'

hints:
1 Sorting a binary subsequence can only move '0' characters to the left and '1' characters to the right.
2 Therefore, a binary string t is reachable from s if both strings contain the same number of '1' characters and, for every prefix, t contains no more '1' characters than the corresponding prefix of s.
3 For each string in strs, determine how many '?' characters must become '1'. To minimize the number of ones in every prefix, assign these ones to the rightmost possible '?' positions.
4 After this assignment, check the prefix condition against s.
