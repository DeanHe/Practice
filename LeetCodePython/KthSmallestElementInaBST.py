"""
Given the root of a binary search tree, and an integer k, return the kth smallest value (1-indexed) of all the values of the nodes in the tree.

Example 1:
Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3
Output: 3


Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is n.
1 <= k <= n <= 10^4
0 <= Node.val <= 10^4


Follow up: If the BST is modified often (i.e., we can do insert and delete operations) and you need to find the kth smallest frequently, how would you optimize?

hint:
1 Try to utilize the property of a BST.
2 Try in-order traversal.
3 What if you could modify the BST node's structure?
4 The optimal runtime complexity is O(height of BST).
