"""
You are given an array nums which is a
permutation
 of [0, 1, 2, ..., n - 1]. The score of any permutation of [0, 1, 2, ..., n - 1] named perm is defined as:

score(perm) = |perm[0] - nums[perm[1]]| + |perm[1] - nums[perm[2]]| + ... + |perm[n - 1] - nums[perm[0]]|

Return the permutation perm which has the minimum possible score. If multiple permutations exist with this score, return the one that is
lexicographically smallest
 among them.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,0,2]
Output: [0,1,2]
Explanation:
The lexicographically smallest permutation with minimum cost is [0,1,2]. The cost of this permutation is |0 - 0| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 1| = 2.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,2,1]
Output: [0,2,1]
Explanation:
The lexicographically smallest permutation with minimum cost is [0,2,1]. The cost of this permutation is |0 - 1| + |2 - 2| + |1 - 0| = 2.

Constraints:
2 <= n == nums.length <= 14
nums is a permutation of [0, 1, 2, ..., n - 1].

hints:
1 The score function is cyclic, so we can always set perm[0] = 0 for the smallest lexical order.
2 Itâ€™s similar to the Traveling Salesman Problem. Use Dynamic Programming.
3 Use a bitmask to track which elements have been assigned to perm.
